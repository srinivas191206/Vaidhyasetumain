## Step 2: Connect and Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions. Copy the repository URL and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/thaladasrinivas/Downloads/telemed-bridge-main

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/srinivas191206/clinic-pro-telemedicine.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

After pushing, go to your GitHub repository URL:
`https://github.com/srinivas191206/clinic-pro-telemedicine`

You should see all your project files including:
- ✅ src/ folder with React components
